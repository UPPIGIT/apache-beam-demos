Next are Undeads.

Undeads are just on the opposite side of Zombie tasks.

Where zombie tasks were those whose status in metadata was running but in actual they

were not getting execute by workers, Undead processes on contrary are those tasks for

which scheduler is getting the heartbeat from workers but Airflow isn’t aware of that

task and doesn’t have a ‘running’ status in the database.

Basically, this kind of mismatch occurs when the state of Airflow database is altered by

some external manual actions.

To these types of tasks you can either say they are in undead state or directly call

them as undead tasks.

And How Airflow deals with Undead task.

It terminates them.

Let me present an example of it.

I will run the tutorial DAG again.

By doing this basically you would be deleting its entry from metadata.

Task has been shut down leading it to in undead state.

Refresh it and it is terminated.

This much only for Undeads.
